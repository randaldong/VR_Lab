## 2. Implementation

Imagine that you have been tasked with re-furnishing the VR lab in room B210.

Place the user in the center of the empty space (5 points). The room should be empty when the application starts.

### 2.1 Must-have functions

- [ ] Spawning: Allow the users to spawn two different items of your choices (5 points), and provide a way for the user to modify the placement and orientation (10 points). Once spawned, the objects should have physics properties attached to them and react to gravity and collisions (5 points).

- [ ] Selection and manipulation: Allow the users to select already placed items in the space and highlight the corresponding selections (10 point). We expect two different interaction schemes for selection (5 points for the second selection method). Allow manipulation of the highlighted objects. After an item is selected, design a way to allow the users to move, rotate and scale the item (10 points). Only the trigger button and the grip button are allowed to be used.

- [ ] Travel: The user should be able to move around the space allowing free movement from one side to the other and control over orientation (5 points movement, 5 points orientation)

- [ ] Indicator: It is not necessary to use a ray, but you should include an indicator/pointer for each corresponding selection and travel method (5 points for selections, 5 points for travel).

### 2.2 Extra credit

- [ ] Improve the spawning method: Design a way to allow the user to spawn large variety of different items in the space. It can be a menu, gesture or anything else (5 points)

- [ ] Group selection and manipulation: Design a way for the user to select more than one items in the scene and manipulate them all at once. We expect to see translation, orientation, scaling and duplication for the manipulation (5 points).
